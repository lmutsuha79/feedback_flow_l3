# Feedback Flow

## description

The project idea is to create a web application that helps app owners on Google Play to improve their application based on customer reviews and ratings. The application will collect customer reviews and ratings and perform sentiment analysis on them to determine customer satisfaction levels. The application will also use topic modeling to identify the most commonly mentioned features or issues in the reviews. The results of the analysis will then be presented to the app owners in an easy-to-understand format, along with suggested updates and improvements to the application based on the feedback. Overall, the goal of the application is to help app owners make data-driven decisions to improve their applications and increase customer satisfaction.
